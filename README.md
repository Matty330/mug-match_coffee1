## Description

Calling all coffee enthusiasts!!! We have created a website in order for you to share and look for new recipes and cafes. Take our quiz to see which drink you should try ordering next, or save your favorite drinks to show the barista what your friend likes to order. Mug match allows users the ability to create a new memory involving our favorite things: connection and coffee. It's easy to grab a cup of your all time favorite roast, but what about when you're craving something different. Picking up a drink for someone to cheer them up? Save their drink in favorites with their name attached and you won't forget it. In this project, we worked with several languages including React, Javascript, Html, CSS, and used PostgreSQl as our database collective. We hope that this website allows you to enjoy great cups of coffee and find that new spot you've been wanting to try!

## Future Features

IN the future production, we would like to add more functionality to this site and make it more scalable. In terms of the Google Maps API, we would like to create a saved list for each cafe that the user decides to save instead of it being manually written in. Another feature we had thought about including further down the road was to implement notifcations and a dashboard where people could share their feeds/accounts with one another and make it more of a social media application.
